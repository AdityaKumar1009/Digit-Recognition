# Digit-Recognition

Implemented a neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy on training and development sets.
Developed forward and backward propagation functions with ReLU and softmax activation, optimizing parameters through gradient descent.
Designed and evaluated the model with one-hot encoding, accuracy tracking, and visualization of predictions using Matplotlib.
